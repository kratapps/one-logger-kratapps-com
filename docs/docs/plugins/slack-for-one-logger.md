One Logger Plugin to send Slack messages.

## Installation

This plugin is included in the One Logger package.

## Setup

1. Get Slack incoming webhook  
   Create an [incoming webhook](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks). A
   webhook URL should look something like this:
    ```text
    https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
    ```
2. Configure Named Credentials  
   Create a new named credentials. Set endpoint URL to your Slack webhook URL.
   Write down the credential's name.
3. Configure Log Filter  
   Log Filters are custom metadata from One Logger package. In this plugin, we
   use a Log Filter records to filter Log Events to send.
4. Configure Slack for One Logger Settings  
   `Slack for One Logger Settings` is custom metadata used to configure Slack
   integration.
    - **Log Field Set**: Configure the fields to include in the message using a
      field set. The value should be the field set API name. Note that this
      field set is created on the `ok__Log__c` object, but the field values will
      be populated from the `ok__Log_Event__e` record.
    - **Log Filter**: Reference the Log Filter created in the previous step.
    - **Named Credentials**: Specify the name of the named credentials defining
      the Slack webhook URL.
    - **Mention Here**: Add `@here` mention.
    - **Mention User Ids**: Semicolon-separated list of Slack User IDs to
      mention in the message.
